        <p>Hey there! I'm Muhtasim Faiyaz, a full-stack marketer with a passion for blending strategy, creativity, and data to drive growth. Over the past four years, I've navigated the ever-evolving worlds of esports, edtech, AI-powered design, and even high-end retailâ€”picking up an arsenal of skills along the way.</p>
        <p>My journey started at ESPL (Esports Players League), where I learned the ropes of social media marketing, email automation, and content management. From there, I dived into SEO and SEM campaigns at Inmagine Group, helping launch Designs.ai while later spearheading NFT community marketing, raising $2.4 million across four projects.</p>
        <p>Taking a turn into sales, I drove B2B growth at Futurelab.my, expanding its client base from 21 to 150 in just six months while streamlining its B2C sales strategy. But my marketing roots called me back, and at EIG (Esports Innovation Group), I helped redefine branding, executed large-scale esports campaigns, and boosted stakeholder engagement by 25%.</p>
        <p>Recently, I took on a sales leadership role at The Good Feet Store, where I achieved an 85% month-over-month revenue increase, quickly rising to Sales Manager. This experience reinforced my ability to drive conversions, build high-performing teams, and optimize customer journeys.</p>
        <p>With a sharp eye for marketing strategy, a deep understanding of sales psychology, and a love for storytelling, I thrive in roles that challenge me to scale brands, craft compelling campaigns, and create measurable impact. Let's connect and make something awesome!</p>
